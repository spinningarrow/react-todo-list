# React Todo List Lab

### Getting Started
- Fork and clone repo
- `cd todo-list-react-demo`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Tasks
1. Create TodoItem component and integrate it with current TodoList (apply what you’ve learned today about state and props)
2. Implement the ability to mark a todo as done when you click on it
  - this should mark `isCompleted` as true
  - it should also add a css class which makes it display with a strikethrough (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30533171/react-js-conditionally-applying-class-attributes)
3. Extend the abovementioned ability to toggle the `isCompleted` status of a todo
